# EnergyAirBot2019
A Google Chrome extension which solves the game at game.energy.ch in order to win tickets

**How do I install the bot?**

In order to install the EnergyAirBot2019, you'll need to follow theese four steps:
1. Download the latest release of the bot
2. Unzip the downloaded folder
3. Navigate to chrome://extensions and activate the developer-mode
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and choose the extension

And that's it! Now you just need to visit game.energy.ch and register your phone number.
Finally you can reload the page and let the bot get to work :)

**IMPORTANT**

The JWT token sent by the server expires after 15 minutes, which basically means you need to re-register your phone number every 15 minutes to keep the bot working.
Also, every 14.4 minutes two tickets are raffled, so you have the chance to win two tickets every time you reenter your phone number.

Also, I am still trying to figure out if they use some sort of protection against automation/bots.

Have fun :heart:
